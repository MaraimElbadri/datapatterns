The Spending Data Pipeline
-------------------------

.. raw:: html

In this course, we will take you through the steps involved in visualising budget and spending information to make it easy to understand. In the process, you'll learn how to wrangle and clean up some of the most common errors which we see in spending and budget data, as well as doing some dataset gymnastics, such as transposition and cleanup.

                    <p>The formats in which budgets and spending data are often release are often non-machine-readable. Scraping is a technique which allows you to extract information from websites without the painful copy-paste trauma! And, contrary to popular opinion, for simple websites, you don't even need to code! </p>

                    <p>You will often find that governments, when releasing their data - will opt for a layout which looks visually pleasing to the human eye, but not make any sense to a computer. Your computer doesn't care about bold formatting - lines and blank rows and columns that make spreadsheets visually more appealing. In fact, they can often confuse matters. </p>
