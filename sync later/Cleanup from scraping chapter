Import HTML v2 to extract - split cell columns 

**Walkthrough:** Importing HTML tables into Google Spreadsheets. 

#. Go to http://drive.google.com, log in and create a new spreadsheet
#. Edit cell A1 (the top left cell)
#. Let’s import the table of UK MPs
#. Enter the following formula into the cell: =importHTML(“http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/mps/”,”table”,2) (The last number indicates the number of the table in the document, just try them out and find the matching one...)

#. Press Enter
#. Wait for a while and see the a table magically appear

#. Now let’s do a little cleanup: Delete all heading rows (the ones containing *A* *B* and so on)
#. Notice how if you work with the sheet, the deleted rows appear again and again? This is because the formula keeps refreshing the content.
#. In order to change the content or delete it, we’ll need to copy the content of the first sheet into another sheet
#. Select the two columns that were imported in the spreadsheet
#. Copy them using “ctrl”+”c”
#. Create a new sheet in your spreadsheet

#. Notice how the first column contains three pieces of information (Surname, Name and Party). Let’s split this up
#. The surname is separated from the name and the party by a simple comma - let’s split it here.
#. The formula you’re going to use is =SPLIT(). It takes two values: 1. the String to be split 2. the delimiter.
#. Label the third column “Surname”. This is where our surname is going to be
#. In the second row enter =SPLIT(A2,”,”) and press enter

#. This will split up the second row for Surname and Firstname (Party)
#. Extend the formula all the way down.
#. Now you can do the same with the first name (split with “(“ as delimiter)
#. Last let’s remove the trailing parenthesis from the party name
#. We are going to combine two formulas: =LEFT and =LEN. =LEFT gives us n characters of a text and LEN gives us the length of the text. We want all characters except the last one - so the formula is =LEFT(F2,LEN(F2)-1)

#. If you hide the columns you’re not interested in, you will end up with a sheet having Constituency, Surname and Name and Party of the MP.
